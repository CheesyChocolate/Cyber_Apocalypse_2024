Surrounded by an untamed forest and the serene waters of the Primus river, your
sole objective is surviving for 24 hours. Yet, survival is far from guaranteed
as the area is full of Rattlesnakes, Spiders and Alligators and the weather
fluctuates unpredictably, shifting from scorching heat to torrential downpours
with each passing hour. Threat is compounded by the existence of a virtual
circle which shrinks every minute that passes. Anything caught beyond its
bounds, is consumed by flames, leaving only ashes in its wake. As the time
sleeps away, you need to prioritise your actions secure your surviving tools.
Every decision becomes a matter of life and death. Will you focus on securing a
shelter to sleep, protect yourself against the dangers of the wilderness, or
seek out means of navigating the Primusâ€™ waters?
